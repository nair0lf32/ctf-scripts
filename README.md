# CTF Sripts

Just a bunch of automation scripts or exploits I wrote while playing CTFs
Here mostly for re-usability (Yeah I am just that lazy).
you guessed those will be mostly in python buuut...

Some of those might be linked later to writeups (If I am not too lazy)

I write them on [zerOne](https://dev.nairolf32.com/zerOne) my cybersecurity blog.

## Usage

I could let you figure it yourself but hey... it's quite simple:

- scripts are named after the challenge I am solving
- scripts are placed in subfolders corresponding to the challenge platform
- if the script requires multiple files to work (crypto challs much) I add all that in a subfolder

## DISCLAIMER

HUGE SPOILER ALERT! If you are playing the same CTFs or solving the same challenges you should make sure to solve them yourself (or at least try a lot)
before looking at the scripts. I put these here mostly for myself (re-usability) and for educational purposes (others can compare their solutions to mine and
vice versa). DO NOT RUIN THE FUN OR THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE!
